<p>As of 2017, nine players have played for both teams in the Rocky Mountain Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
   This was notably started by a trade between the two teams in 2007, in which Colorado's Kyle Beckerman was traded to Salt Lake for Mehdi Ballouchy, both of whom became regular contributors for their new clubs. The trade also corresponded with Salt Lake's control of the Rocky Mountain Cup for many years.
     <br>
  <br>
   In addition, Nat Borchers, Jeff Cunningham, Atiba Harris, Richie Kotschau, Clint Mathis, Chris Wingert, and Luis Gil have also faced off on both sides of the rivalry.</p>
