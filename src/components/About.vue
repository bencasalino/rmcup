<p class="label"> ABOUT THE CUP</p>
<br>
<p>
<span class="emp">The Rocky Mountain Cup</span> is a soccer trophy contested between <a href=""> Real Salt Lake</a>  and the <a href="">Colorado Rapids</a> . The cup is awarded by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountain_Cup#The_Committee_of_10">Committee of 10,</a>
, a group of bi-partisan fans who run the competition, to the team with the most points in games played between the two.
<br>
<br>
 The teams are awarded 3 points for each win and 1 point for each tie in regular season MLS games against each other. The Cup is awarded at the conclusion of the deciding game of the series between the two teams.
<br>
<br>
If the teams end the season in a points tie, the team with the most goals on aggregate will win
<span class="slant"> (for a two-team competition, this is equivalent to goal differential)</span>. If the teams are tied on aggregate goals, the current holders retain the Cup for another year.
<br>
<br>
<p class="label2"> CUP CREATION</p>
The Cup was created in 2005, the first year of play for <a href=""> Real Salt Lake</a> in Major League Soccer. When it was officially announced that Salt Lake City would be awarded an MLS expansion club, fans from Utah and Colorado founded the bi-partisan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountain_Cup#The_Committee_of_10">Committee of 10,</a> <span class="slant">  (5 supporters from each club) </span> and began to outline the official rules of the competition. The contest was named the <span class="emp"> Rocky Mountain Cup</span>  after a vote from the fans, and a trophy was acquired.
<br>
<br>
<p class="label2"> INAGURAL CUP</p>
<span class="emp">The Rocky Mountain Cup</span> began on April 16, 2005 at Real Salt Lake's inaugural home game, in which Real earned their first-ever win with a 1â€“0 victory. Colorado eventually won the trophy in 2005 after besting Real in the three subsequent matches that season, officially clinching the Cup at their final meeting of the year at Rice-Eccles Stadium.
